Proposal refresh not working

What should the initial value for supplements be?
Flag for marking reports as finished.

Security features intentionally disabled for testing:
  -Edit page:
    Disabled redirection of unaffiliated users
    Can edit published proposals (later, this will lock you out after a week)
    Can duplicate usernames across forms (Use a single person as the primary/budget/org contact)
    Disabled verification of signer's username (can sign as another person's username)
  -Proposal page:
    Report completion

Features up for debate:
  - Metrics currently do not refresh, upon update, since I want to capture a "snapshot" in time when you load the page. We could have this be real time, but we lose the benefit of being  able to compare before-after voting meetings.

Known issues:
  Refresh buttons

Quirks of note:
  Occasionally, when creating a new proposal, initial budgets that are submitted are dropped. I need help tracing the circumstances behind this.
  To enforce consistency in the editing page, we pull data from the server every time a tab is selected. This prevents a erroneous field on the client side from being pushed and propegating multiple times, enforcing some integrity.
  For the Proposal/Reviews page, I need to know what you want to see. Metrics? Reviews? Decisions and their total breakdown? I built that page a long time ago and now that I've added committee/dashboard, I'm not so sure that it's necessary.
  Currently, proposal statuses have to be updated after a decision has been issued. I am unsure where this logic should go, since we've discussed the need for a human element as an intermediary.
  Should voting be a separate page?
